# About The Project

Lovec aims to digitise the hunting industry by transferring the current processes in the hunting industry into a digital format that is accessible to users on their mobile device. The software solution allows users to organise common hunting parties, view and book observation posts, tour districts and information about their families, manage trainees’ logbooks and the trainees’ own entry of these logbooks, view and manage equipment and, finally, the entry and checking of entries. In addition, it also includes a view for the system supervisor, who can modify the workflow management of the application. The application is written using the Ionic and Vue.js frameworks.
